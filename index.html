            <b>Economic indicators</b> are statistics that are used to obtain a more precise picture of the state of the economy today, as their name suggests. Few pertinent examples include the <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b>, the <b>Unemployment Rate</b>, <b>Trade, and Globalisation</b>. When anticipating how the economy will develop over the coming years, economic data and their interpretation by reliable sources are crucial.

        <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left">
            With the help of these forecasts, both consumers and businesses will be able to make informed choices about their long-term financial plans, including where and how much money to invest, whether to hire more people or cut back, whether to buy real estate, etc.

            The <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b> is a common statistic used by countries around the world to assess how well they are doing economically. GDP is a gauge of how much money has been made through time from the production of products and services. The GDP of a nation is widely used to gauge economic health and determine whether the economy is growing or experiencing a recession.

        <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left">
            The COVID-19 virus grew alarmingly in 2020, sickening millions of people and halting economic activity as nations implemented tight travel restrictions to stop the infection's spread.
            The world's largest economic shock in decades has already occurred, and the economic damage is evident as the health and human toll mounts.
            The area chart shows the change in GDP per capita over the previous ten years, while the map below shows the GDP per capita in 2020. Virtually every nation's GDP rate has been impacted by the virus, and a 5.2 percent decline in the global GDP rate is anticipated in 2020. It is considered as the worst global recession in decades, despite unprecedented efforts by governments to counteract the downturn through fiscal and monetary policy support.

            <b>Unemployment</b> refers to those who are available to work but are still unable to locate work, and it is utilized as an economic indicator. The unemployment rate is a significant issue for governments, as unemployed people do not pay taxes but instead get benefits. As a result, the government's finances are harmed by high unemployment, resulting in increased public borrowing.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left">
            Unemployment has numerous effects on society and the economy. Increased criminal activity, homelessness, drug usage, and gang activity are all examples of this. The unemployment rate is divided into three categories, which are described below.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;text-align:left">
            The bar chart depicts the unemployment rate for five consecutive years, demonstrating a slight drop before COVID-19. Because of the epidemic, a large increase in unemployment was predicted, but the actual figures were far greater.
